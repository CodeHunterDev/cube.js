You can query Cube from Jupyter notebooks via [SQL API][ref-sql-api].

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import warnings
import pandas

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

conn = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/db')

data_frame = pandas.read_sql('SELECT MEASURE(total_sum), status from orders GROUP BY status');
```
